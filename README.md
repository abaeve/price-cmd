# chremoas-command-template

This project holds the bare minimum to implement a command as a service using the chremoas bot.  Simply copy anything you need into your own project and start editing the command/command.go file and actually implement the Help and Exec functions.  Edit the main.go file and change the name global to the name of your command and create the application.yaml by copying the application.dist.yaml and following the example outlined in there.
